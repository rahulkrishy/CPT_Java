//Java - JDK 21
/*
Java was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. 
Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself.
Java - Just Another Virtual Accelerator.
It was originally designed for interactive television, but its developers soon realized its potential for Internet applications. 
In 1995, Java 1.0 was released to the public, and it quickly gained popularity due to its key features like platform independence, object-oriented nature, robustness, and security.

// Java is Platform Independent (WORA - Write Once Run Anywhere)
/*
-JDK (Java Development Kit): Used by developers for writing, compiling, and packaging Java applications. Includes compiler, JRE, and development tools.
-JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Used by end-users for running Java applications. Includes JVM and Java class libraries.
-JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Executes Java bytecode and provides a runtime environment for Java applications. Handles memory management and platform independence.
In short, JDK is for development, JRE is for running applications, and JVM is the runtime environment executing the Java bytecode.

Java is a platform-independent programming language. 
You can run your application on any machine regardless of its hardware or operating system. 
However, the machine must have a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which itself is platform-dependent. 
This means that while your Java code is platform-independent, the JVM required to execute it is not.
To run Java programs, you need additional libraries during runtime. 
The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) combines the JVM with these extra libraries. 
When running programs on another machine, only the JRE and JVM are necessary; the Java Development Kit (JDK) is not required. 
This characteristic is why Java is known as 'Write Once, Run Anywhere' (WORA)."

//Key Features:
/* 
1)Platform Independence:  Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which is platform-independent. 
                          This bytecode can be executed on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making Java applications highly portable.
2)Object-Oriented:  Java is a fully object-oriented programming language, meaning it supports concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
                    This promotes code reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance.
3)Robustness: Java was designed with a strong emphasis on reliability and error handling. 
              Features like strong type checking, automatic memory management (garbage collection), and exception handling contribute to the robustness of Java programs.
4)Security: Java's security model protects users from harmful code. 
            The JVM enforces security restrictions, such as preventing unauthorized access to system resources and executing untrusted code in a sandboxed environment.
5)Multi-threading:  Java provides built-in support for multi-threading, allowing concurrent execution of multiple tasks within a single program. 
                    This enables developers to create responsive and efficient applications.
6)Rich API: Java comes with an extensive library of classes and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) known as the Java API. 
            This library provides ready-to-use components for tasks like I/O operations, networking, GUI development, and more, saving developers time and effort.

//Applications of Java:
/* 
Enterprise Applications:  Java's scalability, reliability, and portability make it popular for developing large-scale enterprise applications, 
                          including banking systems, e-commerce platforms, and customer relationship management (CRM) software.
Web Development:  Java is commonly used for server-side web development. 
                  Technologies like Servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and JavaServer Faces (JSF) enable developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
Mobile Development: With platforms like Android being powered by Java, the language is extensively used for developing mobile applications. 
                    Android Studio, the official IDE for Android development, uses Java as its primary language.
Desktop Applications: Java's Swing and JavaFX libraries facilitate the development of cross-platform desktop applications with rich graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
Embedded Systems: Java's portability and security features make it suitable for developing embedded systems, such as smart cards, set-top boxes, and industrial automation
